Git for creating a one vs. two-year Statute of Limitation Impact Factsheet.

## Overview
Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee are the only three states within the 50 states and D.C. that have one-year statutes of limitations in civil cases. This means that claimants have one year after the event to file a complaint for damages, or their claim expires. The short one-year statutes of limitations in civil cases in Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee can impose significant challenges on individuals seeking justice. This narrow timeframe may leave victims with inadequate time to gather evidence, explore legal options, or recover from trauma before their claims expire. This narrow timeframe may leave victims with inadequate time to gather evidence.

## Goal
The goal of this factsheet is to analyze the impact of Statutes of Limitation length on the number of police action cases per court, the merit of these cases, and the disproportionate impact of statutes of limitation length on Black people.

## Data 
The data was gathered using Lex Machina, a litigation research company on August 25th, 2023, and spans all civil rights cases for police action in all 94 Federal Courts between January 1st, 2009, and August 25th, 2023.
